"Stationeers get hungry eventually, but not all food is created equal. Also, your hunger rate varies depending on settings and difficulty. Eating will only consume that part of an item adequate to restoring your hunger to 100%.\n"
"\n"
"Stationeers receive supplies of food such as an <color=#0080FFFF>{LINK:Agrizero;Agrizero}</color> {THING:ItemCerealBar} in their lander upon arriving on a new world. When these are exhausted, you must find new sources of sustenance.\n"
"\n"
"Eating raw ingredients will satisfy hunger less than meals, ie will replace a smaller proportion of your hunger. The basic elements of food are created using <color=#0080FFFF>{LINK:OrganicsPage;hydroponics}</color> systems. These can be processed into recipe ingredients using the {THING:ApplianceReagentProcessor}, then turned into meals using a {THING:ApplianceMicrowave}.\n"
"\n"
"Your hunger rate can be adjusted set in the main settings menu by adjusting the Hunger/Hydration rate slider.\n"

"Your average Stationeer needs to drink water regularly. However, arcane and possibly misguided <color=#0080FFFF>{LINK:ODA;ODA}</color> health and safety regulations have long denied Stationeers the right to in-suit hydration mechanisms. Instead, they must take regular drink breaks to open their helmet, and imbibe water. Doing so in an unpressurized environment is unadvised.\n"
"\n"
"How often to drink? This is determined by your difficulty level, the heat of the planet and how much you like to move your body.\n"
"\n"
"Water comes in many forms. At least one {THING:ItemWaterBottle} is supplied to Stationeers as part of their rations when landing on new planets, with more in your lander crates. These can be refilled using a {THING:ItemWaterBottleFiller}, which must itself be connected to a liquid pipe network. The network itself can be filled using a {THING:StructureIceCrusher} with a suitable supply of ice.\n"

"Your spacesuit provides you with a portable atmosphere, with adjustable pressure and air conditioning (temperature) settings, as well as an warning system that will alert you should the atmosphere inside the suit become hazardous. It functions in conjunction with a suitable helmet to function properly, as well as suitable gas canisters and filters in the suit's various slots. These will need to be changed regularly, and can also be recharged (or drained) using a {THING:StructureSuitStorage}.\n"
"\n"
"There are several suits, including the {THING:ItemEvaSuit} and the more pressure- and temperature-resistant {THING:ItemHardSuit}.\n"
"\n"
"Your suit various readouts are at the bottom-right of the screen. Pressing the appropriate numeric key (2will bring up a panel showing its slots and settings. These include:\n"
"\n"
"- A/C On / Off (i.e. Temperature control on/off)\n"
"- Filters On / Off\n"
"- Air On / Off\n"
"- Pressure Up / Down (with a range of 0kPA to 202kPa, or 0-2 Earth atmospheres)\n"
"- Temperature Up / Down (with a range of 0°C to 60°C)\n"
"\n"
"Suits contains 6-8 slots:\n"
"- Air tank (x1) - insert a canister or smart canister containing a breathable gas mix, eg O2 or nitrogen/oxygen 35/65.\n"
"- Waste tank (x1) - collects gases removed by the filters\n"
"- Life support (x1) - holds one battery, which powers your A/C, lights, etc.\n"
"- Filters (x3) - requires at least one CO2 filter (if human), depending on your breathable gas mix. Note that a {THING:ItemHardSuit} has 4 filter slots.\n"
"- IC - {THING:ItemHardSuit} only.\n"
"\n"
"Pressure: should be set to 50-100 KPa (0.5 to 1 Earth atmospheres). Humans in-game tolerate up to ~250kPa and can survive up to ~300kPA.\n"
"\n"
"Temperature: normally set to 18-21°C, with humans in-game preferring 10-29°C, tolerating 0-39°C and surviving around up to 49°C. In higher temperatures, your A/C will consume more battery power to maintain internal temperature.\n"
"\n"
"Filters: the default filter is the CO2 filter, which captures the gas generated by humans when breathing out. If you are not using 100% oxygen in your breathing gas, add additional filters, eg if you mix 25% Oxygen + 75% nitrogen, the nitrogen will accumulate in your suit over time and suffocate you, unless you have a nitrogen filter. If you have the correct filters and breathable gas, but are still experiencing problems, use the 'Flush' function on your Space Helmet. Low/critical oxygen warnings will sound as your filters cease to function.\n"
"\n"
"If damaged, your suit can be patched by holding duct tape in your hand and using 'activate' button.\n"
