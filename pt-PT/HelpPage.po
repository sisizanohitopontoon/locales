"{HEADER:Welcome to a new world}\n"
"If this is your first time then it is a lot to learn at once. The initial pressures on you are great and it can be really overwhelming to get started. The following is some general guidelines to get going. Each world type has different problems you need to face, but the following should give you a broad overview of what you need to manage.\n"
"      \n"
"{HEADER:Keeping your Suit Charged}\n"
"The most pressing need you have is recharging the {THING:ItemBatteryCellLarge} in your {THING:ItemEvaSuit}. The suit battery is used to power your {THING:ItemSpaceHelmet} light (turn this off when not in use) and also warm up your internal air. On colder worlds, this draws a lot of power. You will need to place down a {THING:ItemBatteryCharger} and connect it to a power source, the {THING:StructureSolidFuelGenerator} powered with {THING:ItemCoalOre} or the {THING:StructureSolarPanel} are good starter ways to handle this. In an emergency, take batteries out of your {LINK:ToolPage;Tools} to use to keep your suit going or use the supplied {THING:PortableSolarPanel} to charge them.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Improving Power Collection}\n"
"Placing a {THING:StructureAreaPowerControl}, with a {THING:ItemBatteryCell} inserted, between the power source and your chargers will help a great deal. This is because the power source is likely generating more power than the {THING:ItemBatteryCharger} can hold and is wasted. Additionally, while you can manually orient the {THING:StructureSolarPanel}, but automating it to follow the sun will help you a lot. You can use {LINK:LogicUnitPage;Logic Units} to help you with this.\n"
"      \n"
"{HEADER:Managing your Oxygen}\n"
"Your {THING:ItemEvaSuit} and {THING:ItemSpaceHelmet} form a protective shell from the elements. The {THING:ItemEvaSuit} needs {THING:ItemGasCanisterOxygen} to provide you pure {GAS:Oxygen}. Keep an eye on the gas quantity in the tank, you can refill it using the big {THING:DynamicGasCanisterOxygen} provided in your starting gear. There is a \"hazard\" marker indicating the slot you can insert the canister to refill it.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Basic Smelting}\n"
"Once you have some basic power generation up, you need to begin getting more resources. Head out {LINK:MiningPage;Mining} to get basic {LINK:OrePage;Ores}. Place down the {THING:StructureArcFurnace} and connect it behind your {THING:StructureAreaPowerControl}. This will {LINK:SmeltingPage;Smelt} basic {LINK:OrePage;Ores}, such as {THING:ItemIronOre}, {THING:ItemSiliconOre}, and any other non {LINK:AlloyPage;Alloy}.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Basic Fabrication}\n"
"Now that you have {LINK:IngotPage;Ingots} you can insert them into {LINK:FabricatorPage;Fabricators} as a resource. Construct the {THING:StructureAutolathe} from the {THING:ItemKitAutolathe} provided in the starter crates.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Replacing your Filters}\n"
"As you breath in {GAS:Oxygen} you also breath out {GAS:CarbonDioxide}, so you also need a {THING:ItemGasFilterCarbonDioxide} in your {SLOT:Filter} slot. These wear out over time, and you'll need to build new ones on the {THING:StructureHydraulicPipeBender}. This can be made from a {THING:ItemKitHydraulicPipeBender} on the {THING:StructureAutolathe}.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Build a Glass House}\n"
"You will need a small enclosed area to setup {LINK:HydroponicsPage;Hydroponics} to allow you to make {LINK:FoodPage;Food}. Don't make it too big as it will be harder to pressurize. Make plenty of {THING:} using a variant on the {THING:ItemKitWallIron} kits, to allow sunlight in. Ensure the entry is managed using either an automated {LINK:AirlockPage;Airlock} or a manual one. Remember you can open and close unpowered doors using the {THING:ItemCrowbar}.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Pressurize Your Glass House}\n"
"Once you have the area enclosed, {LINK:MiningPage;Mine} some {THING:ItemOxite} and melt this until you have around 100 kPa of pressure in your growing area. Then add some {GAS:CarbonDioxide} to the atmosphere. You can do this easily by taking your Waste Tank from your {THING:ItemEvaSuit} into your hands, opening it, and the closing it and putting it back. This will release the filtered {GAS:CarbonDioxide} from your breathing into the environment. {LINK:PlantPage;Plants} will use this to breath.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Growing Plants}\n"
"Take the provided {THING:DynamicHydroponics} into your new glass house. It has a {THING:ItemGasCanisterWater} to provide the plants {GAS:Water}. Now plant using {THING:ItemPotato} from the starter crates. Plant one first, and verify it is growing before you use the others. They require sunlight, warmth, and a small amount of {GAS:CarbonDioxide} to survive.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Advanced Smelting}\n"
"The {THING:StructureArcFurnace} only allows you to smelt simple {LINK:OrePage;Ores}, and to make more advanced components you will need to use more complex methods to smelt {LINK:AlloyPage;Alloys}. These are done in the {THING:StructureFurnace}, by achieving the right {LINK:PressurePage;Pressure}, {LINK:TemperaturePage;Temperature}, and {LINK:ReagentPage;Reagent} mix ratio. For example to make {THING:ItemSteelIngot} you will need a ratio of one part {REAGENT:Iron} and three parts {REAGENT:Coal}.\n"
"\n"
"You can directly insert {LINK:IcePage;Ices} into the top. If there is no atmosphere to melt them, press the {LOGICTYPE:Activate} button to crush it. The ice will melt automatically if there is enough gas of the right temperature inside. Use a mix of {THING:ItemOxite} and {THING:ItemVolatiles} to start a fire inside, although this will increase the pressure inside dramatically.\n"
"\n"
"Once it is at the right temperature, insert ores to smelt them - but watch your ratios or waste products will come out as {THING:ItemReagentMix} which will need to be sorted in a {THING:StructureCentrifuge}. To export a product, pull the {LOGICTYPE:Open} handle.\n"

"{HEADER:Welcome to a new world}\n"
"Se é a tua primeira vez então é muito o que tens de aprender. A pressão inicial é muita e pode ser realmente esmagadora para começar. O texto que se segue é apenas um guia geral para seguires. Cada tipo de mundo tem problemas específicos que precisas de resolver, mas aqui terás uma visão geral do que precisarás para te orientar.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Keeping your Suit Charged}\n"
"A necessidade mais urgente que tens é de recarregar a {THING:ItemBatteryCellLarge} no teu {THING:ItemEvaSuit}. A bateria do fato é usada para a iluminação do teu {THING:ItemSpaceHelmet} (desliga a luz quando não precisas) e também para aquecer o ar interno do fato. Em mundos mais frios isto drena muita energia. Vais precisar de montar um {THING:ItemBatteryCharger} e ligá-lo a uma fonte de energia. Um {THING:StructureSolidFuelGenerator} a funcionar com {THING:ItemCoalOre} ou um {THING:StructureSolarPanel} são boas maneiras de solucionar isto. Numa emergência, retira baterias das {LINK:ToolPage;Tools} para manteres o teu fato a funcionar ou usa um {THING:PortableSolarPanel} para recarregá-las.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Improving Power Collection}\n"
"Colocar um {THING:StructureAreaPowerControl} com uma {THING:ItemBatteryCell} inserida, entre a fonte de energia e os teus carregadores vai ajudar te muito. Isto porque a fonte de energia está a gerar mais energia do que a {THING:ItemBatteryCharger} consegue armazenar e é desperdiçada. Adicionalmente, embora possas orientar o {THING:StructureSolarPanel} manualmente, automatizá-lo de modo a seguir o sol vai ajudar te muito. Podes usar  {LINK:LogicUnitPage;Logic Units} para ajudar te a conseguir isto.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Managing your Oxygen}\n"
"O teu {THING:ItemEvaSuit} e o teu {THING:ItemSpaceHelmet} formam um escudo de proteção contra os elementos. O {THING:ItemEvaSuit} precisa de um {THING:ItemGasCanisterOxygen} para providenciar te {GAS:Oxygen} puro. Toma atenção à quntidade de gás no cilindro e podes o reabastecer usando o {THING:DynamicGasCanisterOxygen} que recebeste com o equipamento inicial. Existe um marcador de perigo indicando o compartimento em que o cilindro pode ser inserido para reabastecimento.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Basic Smelting}\n"
"Após teres algum sistema de geração de energia criado, precisas de começar a obter mais recursos. Dá uma volta {LINK:MiningPage;Mining} para obteres {LINK:OrePage;Ores}. Monta uma {THING:StructureArcFurnace} e liga-a atrás do teu {THING:StructureAreaPowerControl}. Isto irá {LINK:SmeltingPage;Smelt} {LINK:OrePage;Ores}, como por exemplo, {THING:ItemIronOre}{THING:ItemSiliconOre} e muitas outras que não sejam  {LINK:AlloyPage;Alloy}.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Basic Fabrication}\n"
"Agora que tens {LINK:IngotPage;Ingots} podes inseri-los no {LINK:FabricatorPage;Fabricators}  como recursos. Constroi o {THING:StructureAutolathe} a partir do {THING:ItemKitAutolathe} que for providenciado com as caixas de início do jogo.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:Replacing your Filters}\n"
"Ao respirares {GAS:Oxygen} também exalas {GAS:CarbonDioxide}, por isso precisas de um {THING:ItemGasFilterCarbonDioxide} no compartimento {SLOT:Filter} do fato. Este vai ser usado e precisarás de produzir novos numa {THING:StructureHydraulicPipeBender}. isto pode ser feito de um {THING:ItemKitHydraulicPipeBender} num {THING:StructureAutolathe}.\n"
