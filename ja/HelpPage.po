msgid ""
"In order to control the temperature of a system, we have to either add heat to it thus increasing its temperature or remove heat from it thus cooling it down, that's the basic idea of temperature control. Devices that achieve this goal for you are {THING:ItemWallHeater}, {THING:ItemWallCooler}, {THING:StructurePipeRadiator}, and {THING:StructureAirConditioner}.\n"
"\n"
"NOTE: There are many methods of temperature control. Some involve none of the devices mentioned. Here, we are covering the basics.\n"
"\n"
"It is important to understand your environment before you install any type of temperature control. The gas or liquid volume is an important factor to when choosing your method of temperature control. A {THING:StructureTankSmall} can hold up to 6000L, while a {THING:StructureTankBig} can hold up to 50,000L, which means that if both are full, the small tank will react faster to temperature changes. A room is a space that can hold a certain amount of gas. The bigger it is the more volume it will be able to hold, so the same rules generally apply to tanks and rooms.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:PIPE NETWORKS}\n"
"A pipe network is one or more pipe segments connected to each other with no separation at any point. A pipe network shares the same atmosphere everywhere along the pipe, no matter how large it is. If you change the temperature or pressure at one end of the network, the furthest end will experience the same change immediately with no delay.\n"
"\n"
"Adding devices to a network may split it into two different networks. For instance, adding a {THING:StructureVolumePump} to a pipe network will split the network into two networks: one before the pump, and one after it.\n"
"\n"
"Use the {THING:ItemTablet} with the {THING:CartridgeAtmosAnalyser} installed to see information about the contents of any pipe network.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:RADIATORS}\n"
"Manufactured in the pipe bender, a {THING:StructurePipeRadiator} will help you exchange heat between pipes and their surrounding environment. They work on both insulated pipes and pipes, as well as having liquid variants. \n"
"\n"
"In normal conditions a pipe segment will exchange heat with its surrounding environment, but adding a radiator to that pipe segment will speed up the process greatly. A pipe segment will keep exchanging heat with the surrounding atmosphere until both equalize in temperature.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:PASSIVE COOLING}\n"
"You can cool or heat any environment by using a {THING:StructurePipeRadiator} to exchange heat between two atmospheres. An example of this would be to place a pipe on the wall, fill it with gas, and place radiators on the pipe. Now the two atmospheres of the pipe and the room will exchange temperature until their environments equalize.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:WALL HEATER}\n"
"The {THING:ItemWallHeater} is a simple device that can be installed on a wall or a frame and connected to power. When switched on, it will start heating the surrounding environment. It consumes 1010W of power and can be controlled by logic chips to run when the temperature hits a certain level.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:WALL COOLER}\n"
"The {THING:ItemWallCooler} complements the wall heater, which can only raise the temperature. The wall cooler functions by drawing heat from the surrounding atmosphere and adding that heat into its pipe network. In order to run the wall cooler properly, you will need to connect pipes to the wall cooler and fill the connected pipe network with any type of gas. The gas's heat capacity and volume will determine how fast it reacts to temperature changes. \n"
"\n"
"The higher the difference in temperature between the gas stored in the pipes and the room, the less efficient the wall cooler will be. So to keep the wall cooler running at an acceptable efficiency you will need to get rid of the heat that accumulates in the pipes connected to it. A common practice would be to run the pipes to the outside and use radiators on the outside section of the pipes to get rid of the heat.\n"
"\n"
"The less efficient the wall cooler, the less power it consumes. It will consume 1010W at max efficiency. The wall cooler can be controlled by logic chips to run when the temperature hits a certain degree.\n"
"\n"
"If the wall cooler is flashing an error then it is missing one of the following:\n"
"- Pipe connection to the wall cooler.\n"
"- Gas in the connected pipes, or pressure is too low.\n"
"- Atmosphere in the surrounding environment or pressure is too low.\n"
"\n"
"{HEADER:AIR CONDITIONER}\n"
"The {THING:StructureAirConditioner} in its basic form works just like the wall cooler and can benefit from the same designs. However it is more powerful. It cools faster and uses considerably more power depending on the situation, thus making it more suitable to deal with large volumes and large areas. It can heat or cool depending on the setting.\n"
"\n"
"AIR CONDITIONER: HOW IT WORKS\n"
"The air conditioner has 3 pipe connections (Input, Output, Waste). Gas goes in through the input side, then, depending on the setting, heat is added or removed from the incoming gas, and added to the waste pipe. The output gas will then exit through the output connection, cooler or hotter depending on the setting.\n"
"You can connect the input pipe to the output pipes (you can see if they are connected if they both have the same network number): this will give you more control over the temperature, since the gas won't reach the target temperature after the first pass. It will take time and energy to remove or add heat from any gas.\n"
"\n"
"The way you install and set up your air conditioner depends on what you are trying to cool or heat up. For a room, you will need a passive vent inside the room connected to the air conditioner's input and output, while the waste pipe has to be filled with a coolant gas. \n"
"\n"
"The air conditioner does not have to be inside the room. The only part of this setup that has to be in the room is the passive vent which will circle the room's atmosphere through to the air conditioner to be cooled or heated. \n"
"\n"
"You can use a single air conditioner to do both heating and cooling. You just need to change the target temperature setting on the panel. However, if you want to automate cooling and heating at the same time you will need one air conditioner for cooling and another one for heating, because the setting on the panel can only be changed manually.\n"
"\n"
"Setting up more than one air conditioner on the same pipe network can be useful if you need things to go faster or if you need to use some for heating and others for cooling. Do this by connecting the inputs and the outputs of the air conditioners together and having them all share the same pipe network for their inputs and outputs. The waste pipe network can also be shared between them, but it has to be separate from the input/output pipe network. The same idea applies when using the air conditioner to control the temperature of tanks. However, instead of using a passive vent, you will need to connect the tank to the air conditioner directly.\n"
"\n"
"AIR CONDITIONER: KEEP IN MIND\n"
"- The greater the difference in temperature between the input pipe and the waste pipe, the more power the air conditioner will use\n"
"- The power consumed by the air conditioner can exceed 5kW, therefore using heavy cables to power up air conditioners is recommended.\n"
"- Running the waste pipe outside and equalizing it with the outside atmosphere isn't always the best option: the gas you put inside of it can be applied somewhere else in your base.\n"
"\n"
"AIR CONDITIONER: BASE TEMPERATURE CONTROL\n"
"There are many ways to control the temperature of your base using air conditioners - this is one way of achieving this goal:\n"
"Step 1: Run a single pipe network around your base, and install passive vents connected to this pipe in every room you wish to be controlled by this setup. This is 'Network A'\n"
"Step 2: Connect 'Network A' to an air conditioner's input and output.\n"
"Step 3: Connect the waste pipe to a different network, and run it to the outside. Install radiators on this network.\n"
"This is the basic setup. To automate it you will need a pipe analyzer on Network A, then read the temperature and run your air conditioner(s) accordingly.\n"
"Good luck, Cadet!\n"

#~ "{HEADER:Welcome to a new world}\n"
#~ "If this is your first time then it is a lot to learn at once. The initial pressures on you are great and it can be really overwhelming to get started. The following is some general guidelines to get going. Each world type has different problems you need to face, but the following should give you a broad overview of what you need to manage.\n"
#~ "      \n"
#~ "{HEADER:Keeping your Suit Charged}\n"
#~ "The most pressing need you have is recharging the {THING:ItemBatteryCellLarge} in your {THING:ItemEvaSuit}. The suit battery is used to power your {THING:ItemSpaceHelmet} light (turn this off when not in use) and also warm up your internal air. On colder worlds, this draws a lot of power. You will need to place down a {THING:ItemBatteryCharger} and connect it to a power source, the {THING:StructureSolidFuelGenerator} powered with {THING:ItemCoalOre} or the {THING:StructureSolarPanel} are good starter ways to handle this. In an emergency, take batteries out of your {LINK:ToolPage;Tools} to use to keep your suit going or use the supplied {THING:PortableSolarPanel} to charge them.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:Improving Power Collection}\n"
#~ "Placing a {THING:StructureAreaPowerControl}, with a {THING:ItemBatteryCell} inserted, between the power source and your chargers will help a great deal. This is because the power source is likely generating more power than the {THING:ItemBatteryCharger} can hold and is wasted. Additionally, while you can manually orient the {THING:StructureSolarPanel}, but automating it to follow the sun will help you a lot. You can use {LINK:LogicUnitPage;Logic Units} to help you with this.\n"
#~ "      \n"
#~ "{HEADER:Managing your Oxygen}\n"
#~ "Your {THING:ItemEvaSuit} and {THING:ItemSpaceHelmet} form a protective shell from the elements. The {THING:ItemEvaSuit} needs {THING:ItemGasCanisterOxygen} to provide you pure {GAS:Oxygen}. Keep an eye on the gas quantity in the tank, you can refill it using the big {THING:DynamicGasCanisterOxygen} provided in your starting gear. There is a \"hazard\" marker indicating the slot you can insert the canister to refill it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:Basic Smelting}\n"
#~ "Once you have some basic power generation up, you need to begin getting more resources. Head out {LINK:MiningPage;Mining} to get basic {LINK:OrePage;Ores}. Place down the {THING:StructureArcFurnace} and connect it behind your {THING:StructureAreaPowerControl}. This will {LINK:SmeltingPage;Smelt} basic {LINK:OrePage;Ores}, such as {THING:ItemIronOre}, {THING:ItemSiliconOre}, and any other non {LINK:AlloyPage;Alloy}.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:Basic Fabrication}\n"
#~ "Now that you have {LINK:IngotPage;Ingots} you can insert them into {LINK:FabricatorPage;Fabricators} as a resource. Construct the {THING:StructureAutolathe} from the {THING:ItemKitAutolathe} provided in the starter crates.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:Replacing your Filters}\n"
#~ "As you breath in {GAS:Oxygen} you also breath out {GAS:CarbonDioxide}, so you also need a {THING:ItemGasFilterCarbonDioxide} in your {SLOT:Filter} slot. These wear out over time, and you'll need to build new ones on the {THING:StructureHydraulicPipeBender}. This can be made from a {THING:ItemKitHydraulicPipeBender} on the {THING:StructureAutolathe}.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:Build a Glass House}\n"
#~ "You will need a small enclosed area to setup {LINK:HydroponicsPage;Hydroponics} to allow you to make {LINK:FoodPage;Food}. Don't make it too big as it will be harder to pressurize. Make plenty of {THING:} using a variant on the {THING:ItemKitWallIron} kits, to allow sunlight in. Ensure the entry is managed using either an automated {LINK:AirlockPage;Airlock} or a manual one. Remember you can open and close unpowered doors using the {THING:ItemCrowbar}.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:Pressurize Your Glass House}\n"
#~ "Once you have the area enclosed, {LINK:MiningPage;Mine} some {THING:ItemOxite} and melt this until you have around 100 kPa of pressure in your growing area. Then add some {GAS:CarbonDioxide} to the atmosphere. You can do this easily by taking your Waste Tank from your {THING:ItemEvaSuit} into your hands, opening it, and the closing it and putting it back. This will release the filtered {GAS:CarbonDioxide} from your breathing into the environment. {LINK:PlantPage;Plants} will use this to breath.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:Growing Plants}\n"
#~ "Take the provided {THING:DynamicHydroponics} into your new glass house. It has a {THING:ItemGasCanisterWater} to provide the plants {GAS:Water}. Now plant using {THING:ItemPotato} from the starter crates. Plant one first, and verify it is growing before you use the others. They require sunlight, warmth, and a small amount of {GAS:CarbonDioxide} to survive.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:Advanced Smelting}\n"
#~ "The {THING:StructureArcFurnace} only allows you to smelt simple {LINK:OrePage;Ores}, and to make more advanced components you will need to use more complex methods to smelt {LINK:AlloyPage;Alloys}. These are done in the {THING:StructureFurnace}, by achieving the right {LINK:PressurePage;Pressure}, {LINK:TemperaturePage;Temperature}, and {LINK:ReagentPage;Reagent} mix ratio. For example to make {THING:ItemSteelIngot} you will need a ratio of one part {REAGENT:Coal} and three parts {REAGENT:Iron}.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "You can directly insert {LINK:IcePage;Ices} into the top. If there is no atmosphere to melt them, press the {LOGICTYPE:Activate} button to crush it. The ice will melt automatically if there is enough gas of the right temperature inside. Use a mix of {THING:ItemOxite} and {THING:ItemVolatiles} to start a fire inside, although this will increase the pressure inside dramatically.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Once it is at the right temperature, insert ores to smelt them - but watch your ratios or waste products will come out as {THING:ItemReagentMix} which will need to be sorted in a {THING:StructureCentrifuge}. To export a product, pull the {LOGICTYPE:Open} handle.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "Even more advanced {LINK:SuperAlloyPage;Superalloys} can be smelted at the {THING:StructureAdvancedFurnace}. They have very tight requirements to smelt and are extremely difficult, but necessary for very advanced manufacturing.\n"

#~ "今回が初めての場合は、一度に多くのことを学ぶ必要があります。 最初のプレッシャーは大きく、はじめは本当に圧倒されることがあります。 以下は、始めるための一般的なガイドラインです。 各ワールドタイプでは、あなたは様々な問題に直面するでしょう。 以下では、あなたが何を解決する必要があるか大まかな概要を説明します。\n"
#~ "      \n"
#~ "{HEADER:スーツの充電を維持する}\n"
#~ "最も急を要するのは{THING:ItemEvaSuit}の{THING:ItemBatteryCellLarge}を充電することです。 スーツのバッテリーは{THING:ItemSpaceHelmet}のライトに電力を供給し（使用しないときはこれをオフにしてください）、スーツ内部の空気を暖めるために使用されます。 寒いワールドでは、多くの電力を消費します。 {THING:ItemBatteryCharger}を置いて電源に接続する必要がありますが、電力を供給するための良い序盤の方法としては{THING:StructureSolarPanel}や{THING:ItemCoalOre}を使った{THING:StructureSolidFuelGenerator}が挙げられます。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:電力の改善}\n"
#~ "{THING:StructureAreaPowerControl}を{THING:ItemBatteryCell}を挿入した状態で、電源と充電器の間に配置すると、非常に役立ちます。 何故かというと、電源は{THING:ItemBatteryCharger}が保持できる電力よりも多くの電力を生成している可能性が高く、生成した電力が無駄になるからです。 さらに、{THING:StructureSolarPanel}の向きを手動で調整することもできますが、自動で太陽に追従するようにすることは非常に役立ちます。 この自動化には{LINK:LogicUnitPage;Logic Units}が役立ちます。\n"
#~ "      \n"
#~ "{HEADER:酸素の管理}\n"
#~ "{THING:ItemEvaSuit}と{THING:ItemSpaceHelmet}は、自然からあなたを保護するためのシェルを形成しています。 {THING:ItemEvaSuit}は綺麗な{GAS:Oxygen}を提供するために{THING:ItemGasCanisterOxygen}を必要とします。 タンク内のガスの量に注意してください。 最初に提供されている大きな{THING:DynamicGasCanisterOxygen}を使用して酸素を補充することができます。 補充するためにキャニスターを挿入できるスロットを示す「ハザード」マーカーがあります。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:基本的な製錬}\n"
#~ "基本的な発電量がある程度上がったら、より多くの資源の収集する必要があります。 基本的な{LINK:OrePage;鉱石}を得るために{LINK:MiningPage;採掘}に向かいましょう。 {THING:StructureArcFurnace}を置いて、あなたの{THING:StructureAreaPowerControl}の後ろに接続してください。 これは、{THING:ItemIronOre}、{THING:ItemSiliconOre}、その他の非{LINK:AlloyPage;合金}などの基本的な{LINK:OrePage;鉱石}を{LINK:SmeltingPage;製錬}します。\n"

#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:フィルターの交換}\n"
#~ "{GAS:Oxygen}を吸うと同時に{GAS:CarbonDioxide}も吐くので、{SLOT:Filter}スロットに{THING:ItemGasFilterCarbonDioxide}が必要です。 これらは時間の経過とともに消耗するので、{THING:StructureHydraulicPipeBender}で新しいものを作る必要があります。 これは{THING:StructureAutolathe}の{THING:ItemKitHydraulicPipeBender}から作ることができます。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:温室を建築する}\n"
#~ "食料を生産するための{LINK:HydroponicsPage;水耕栽培}を開始するには、小さな密閉された空間が必要になります。 {THING:ItemKitWallIron}キットの変化を使用して、日光が入るように{THING:}を多く作ります。 手動、もしくは自動化された{LINK:AirlockPage;エアロック}を使用して入口を管理してください。電源入っていないドアは{THING:ItemCrowbar}を使用して開閉できることを覚えておいてください。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:温室を加圧する}\n"
#~ "エリアを囲んだら、{LINK:MiningPage;採掘}した{THING:ItemOxite}を、栽培エリアの圧力が約100 kPaになるまで溶かしてください。 次に、{GAS:CarbonDioxide}を大気中に加えます。 これは、{THING:ItemEvaSuit}の排気タンクを手に取り、開いて、閉じて元に戻すことで簡単にできます。 これにより、あなたの呼吸からろ過された{GAS:CarbonDioxide}が大気中に放出されます。{LINK:PlantPage;植物}はこれを使って呼吸をします。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:植物の栽培}\n"
#~ "{THING:DynamicHydroponics}をあなたの新しい温室に持って行きましょう。 {THING:DynamicHydroponics}には、植物に{GAS:Water}を与えるための{THING:ItemGasCanisterWater}が付属しています。 次にスタータークレートから{THING:ItemPotato}を使って植物を植えます。最初に1つ植えて、成長していることを確認してから他のものを使うようにしてください。 植物を生存させるには、日光と暖かさ、そして少量の{GAS:CarbonDioxide}が必要です。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "{HEADER:高度な製錬}\n"
#~ "{THING:StructureArcFurnace}では、単純な{LINK:OrePage;鉱石}を製錬することしかできませんが、より高度な部品を作るためには、より複雑な方法で{LINK:AlloyPage;合金}を製錬する必要があります。 この製錬は{THING:StructureFurnace}の中で、{LINK:PressurePage;圧力}、 {LINK:TemperaturePage;温度}、 そして{LINK:ReagentPage;試薬}の混合比を適切にすることで行えます。例えば、{THING:ItemSteelIngot}を作るには、{REAGENT:Coal}を1、{REAGENT:Iron}を3の割合で作る必要があります。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "炉上部に{LINK:IcePage;氷}を直接入れることができます。もし、氷が溶けない場合は{LOGICTYPE:Activate} ボタンを押して氷を潰します。氷は内部に十分な温度の気体があれば自動的に溶けます。{THING:ItemOxite}と{THING:ItemVolatiles}を混ぜたものを使って中で火をおこしましょう。これで炉内部の圧力を劇的に上昇させることもできます。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "適切な温度になったら、鉱石を入れて製錬します。ただし、比率に注意してください。廃棄物として{THING:ItemReagentMix}ができた場合、{THING:StructureCentrifuge}で分離する必要があります。  精製物取り出すには、{LOGICTYPE:Open}ハンドルを引きます。\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "さらに高度な{LINK:SuperAlloyPage;超合金}は{THING:StructureAdvancedFurnace}で製錬することができます。これらは製錬に必要な条件が非常に厳しく、非常に難しいが、非常に高度な製造には必要である。\n"
